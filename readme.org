What I've done in this cold winter of 2019:

Use emacs to wirte *latex*, *markdown*, *python*, *org*, and *git*.

* Emacs First
I make a summary about what I've learned about emacs up to 2020.3.30.And I push the configuration file to github `init.el`

** Better Edit
With the help of evil and many packages I can edit in emacs proficiently;

| key           | function                                    |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| hjkl          | left/down/up/right                          |

* Latex in Emacs
First time I used latex was recommanded by my best friend of USTC. At that time the VScode was the editor I used. It was good, but since I used the emacs and the package of cdlatex, my proficiency is improved greatly.You just need to type few words and type <tab>, it will complete a environment for you.And in math, type ` and there is a list of all kinds special words you need and you can even add some new keybands into it.Type ' and there will be a list of different kinds of fonts.

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
>>> sn<tab> 
\section{}

>>> ss<tab>
\subsection{}

>>>fg<tab>
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[]{}}
\caption[]{AUTOLABEL ?}
\end{figure}

>>>env<tab>
you will need to type a kind of environment



#+END_SRC




and so on.You just need to type 'C-c ?' to see all the shortkey bindings. 

| shortkey          | function                                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| C-c C-c           | choose which way to edit the code such as xelatex |
| C-c C-a           | edit and show the pdf file                        |
| cdlatex-math-list | add new shortkey for some special synbol          |
| M-x shell         | use terminal in emacs                             |


* Markdown
This readme is wirtten in markdown which is a easy and useful compile language. I want to summarize the usual commands for markdown in emacs.

- C-c C-s for all kinds of fonts or title hierarchy.
- C-c C-c for preview or export for many kinds of file.
- C-M-a move to the former title
- C-M-e move to the next title

As for pictures and url I use little and don't talk too much.



* Python

** Python Virtual Environment: A Primer

*** Using Virtual Environments 
Start by making a new directory to work with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	shell
	$mkdir python-virtual-environments && cd python-virtual-environments


#+END_SRC

Create a new virtual environment inside the directory:


#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	shell
	#python 2:
	$ virtualenv env
	
	#Python 3
	$python3 -m venv env 
	


#+END_SRC


In the above example, this command creates a directory called env, which contains a directory structure similar to this:

* Git

Using the package magit, all of the commands can be complished easily and efficiently.

- C-x g will execute the git status (different people have different keybindings)
- s stage the file (like add in git)
- c commit and choose the items you want and press c again to commit
- add the comment you want to commit C-c C-c finish the commit
- P to push what you've done to github
- g refresh the magit
- b for all branch operation

* Org  

Org is just like markdown but better than markdown I think:

** shortkey for headings

-   C-c C-j jump to the title you want
-   S-TAB unfold all title (S- is the shift key)
-   M-left/right increase/decrease the title grade
-   M-S-left/rigt increase/decrease the title and all subtitles grade

** shortkey for chart

C-c | create a chart quickly


* Hyperlinks

[baidu](http:www.baidu.com)
[wechat4.md](wechat4.md)

-   C-c C-l insert links
-   C-c C-o open links

very useful!


#+BEGIN_SRC org

    s    #+begin_src ... #+end_src 
    e    #+begin_example ... #+end_example  : 单行的例子以冒号开头
    q    #+begin_quote ... #+end_quote      通常用于引用，与默认格式相比左右都会留出缩进
    v    #+begin_verse ... #+end_verse      默认内容不换行，需要留出空行才能换行
    c    #+begin_center ... #+end_center 
    l    #+begin_latex ... #+end_latex 
    L    #+latex: 
    h    #+begin_html ... #+end_html 
    H    #+html: 
    a    #+begin_ascii ... #+end_ascii 
    A    #+ascii: 
    i    #+index: line 
    I    #+include: line
    write <s TAB you get the first one

> I just want try



#+END_SRC

* Try Agenda

-   C-c C-t change to todo
-   C-c a for agenda


* Transfer to Other formats

C-c C-e transfer
